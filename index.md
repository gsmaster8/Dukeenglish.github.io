**Hi, welcome to my personal webpage~**

I am now a master student in the school of information science and engineering, Hunan University, China.

My research interests focus on: the access control strategy for cloud computing, especially for Attribute-based encryption.

Also things about **fps game** are also interesting to me. :). 

## Vision
Happy, Healthy.

## Mission
The only thing that I want to do is to make those who love me and those I love happier.
