**Hi, welcome to my personal webpage~**

I am now a master student in the school of information science and engineering, Hunan University, China.

My research interests focus on: the access control strategy for cloud computing, especially for Attribute-based encryption.

Also things about **fps game** are also interesting to me. :).
